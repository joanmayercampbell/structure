    <h1>  What makes it art</h1>

        A friend, commenting on a new building, "I’m not sure if I hate it or love it! I want to hate it but I think I love it..."<br />

        Without that tension, all you've done is what's been done before.<br />

    <h1> Chump (Don't get played)</h1>

    <p>
        How did Bernie Madoff do it? How did he steal twenty billion dollars from people who should have known better? It doesn't matter if you went to university or not--
        you can still be played as a chump.

        To pull off a significant deception, you generally need two things: A deceiver and a crowd of people open to being deceived.
    </p>

    <p> Once those are present, the deceiver brings out the big lie.</p>

    <p>
        For lots of reasons, people are open to looking for shortcuts and a new reality, even if no shortcuts are available. They may have been mistreated, might be
         struggling, or they may merely be greedy, looking to outdo the other guy. In the case of Madoff, he was even able to take in charities, with boards that meant 
        well but were in a hurry to scale.</p>

     <p>   Frustration in the face of the way things are makes us open to the big lie. Frustration and fear and anger can suspend our ability to ask difficult questions,
     to listen to thoughtful critics, to do our homework.</p>

    <p>
        And the big lie is always present when we get played. To be a chump (not merely the victim) is to be open to the big lie. Not merely open to it, eager to buy
        into it.
    </p>

   
    <p>Numbers make it easy to tell a big lie. People hate numbers, and they seem so real.</p>
